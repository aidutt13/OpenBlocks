# OpenBlocks

OpenBlocks is my lesson to learn how a 3D game engines work. The basic concept is to make a game about blocks and digital logic. Yes.

### To do:
    * Move every data type (vector4d, matrix4d, etc) to a seperate header
    * Make a drawing stack (an array of objects to be drawn)
    * Physics Engine!

### Dependencies:
    * PixelGameEngine - simple game engine
    * Jinx - embedded scripting language (not yet but want to implement flexibility)
